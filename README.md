## How much data is sent in one run?

In one run, the publisher sends **5 events** to the RabbitMQ message broker.

Each event is an instance of the following struct:

```rust
pub struct UserCreatedEventMessage {
    pub user_id: String,
    pub user_name: String,
}
```

## Explain the meaning of the connection URL.
amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672

- This URL defines how the publisher connects to the RabbitMQ server using the AMQP protocol.

amqp://
- Specifies that the connection will use the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

guest : guest
- These are the login credentials:
- The first guest is the username
- The second guest is the password
- These are default credentials provided by RabbitMQ.

localhost:5672
- Indicates the host and port:
- localhost means RabbitMQ is running on the same machine.

5672 is the default port for AMQP protocol connections.

This tells the application to connect to a RabbitMQ server running locally, authenticate as guest, and use the standard messaging port.

### Why is the total number of queued messages like that?

In my case, the queue temporarily reached **6 messages**.

Hereâ€™s why:

- I ran the publisher a bit more than once (each run sends 5 messages).
- Because the subscriber takes **1 second per message**, messages build up in the queue when the publisher is faster than the consumer.
- The graph shows:
  - A **flat line at 6** in "Queued messages", indicating the number of events waiting.
  - Then a drop as the subscriber processed messages one-by-one.

## Running at Least Three Subscribers

To test the performance under load, I ran **three instances of the subscriber** simultaneously in different terminal windows. Then, I triggered the publisher multiple times in quick succession.

This setup allowed multiple subscribers to consume messages in parallel.

### Reflection

As seen in the graph, although the queue briefly spiked to **6 messages**, it **dropped to 0 much faster** compared to when only one subscriber was running. This shows how running multiple consumers speeds up the processing of queued events.

**Why this happens:**

- Each subscriber processes one message at a time with a 1-second delay (due to `thread::sleep`).
- With 3 subscribers, up to 3 messages can be processed in parallel every second.
- This reduces the time required to drain the queue significantly.

### Room for improvement

- Currently, the publisher uses repeated `_ = p.publish_event(...)` lines.
- This can be improved using a loop to reduce redundancy:

```rust
for (id, name) in [
    ("1", "Amir"),
    ("2", "Budi"),
    ("3", "Cica"),
    ("4", "Dira"),
    ("5", "Emir"),
] {
    _ = p.publish_event(
        "user_created".to_owned(),
        UserCreatedEventMessage {
            user_id: id.to_string(),
            user_name: format!("2306199775-{}", name),
        },
    );
}
